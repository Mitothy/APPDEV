*It is advisable to run the index.html using VSCode Live Server so it will be able to display the reviews of users in the profile page (apparently it doesnt work if it is not executed this way)

-To see edit/delete review feature of a user, add a review and click submit button and scroll back to reviews section and you should see an edit your review button

-To see edit/delete review feature of an owner, click on the owner's name on the reviews to open the profile and then on the Destination dropdown found on navbar, open a destination webpage and scroll down to the reviews section, there should be buttons to click.
